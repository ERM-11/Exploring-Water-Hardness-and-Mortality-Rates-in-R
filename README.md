# Exploring-Water-Hardness-and-Mortality-Rates-in-R
A statistical project looking at a sample of data on the annual mortality rate for people in 20 large towns in Canada and 20 similar towns in the USA, and the water hardness recorded as the calcium concentration in the drinking water.
The full dataset was provided through Heriot-Watt University in 2023. I am using a sample from it.
