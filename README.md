# Exploring-Water-Hardness-and-Mortality-Rates-in-R
A statistical project looking at a sample of data on the annual mortality rate for people in 20 large towns in Canada and 20 similar towns in the USA, and the water hardness recorded as the calcium concentration in the drinking water.

The full dataset was provided through Heriot-Watt University in 2023, and I am using a very small sample from it. The original dataset has not been uploaded, and instead I have uploaded csv files of the sections of data I am using.

The 3 questions are answered while exploring the data:

It is first desired to compare the calcium concentration in the drinking water in Canada to that in the USA.

1) If you were asked to undertake such a task as a scientist, state how you might go about obtaining samples from both countries and how you can ensure randomness. 

2) Perform an appropriate hypothesis test in order to check whether or not the calcium concentration in drinking water is the same in Canada and in the USA. State why you are choosing this test. Make sure you mention your hypothesis, interpretation of p values and a clear conclusion. Also state any assumptions required for your test and justify whether or not they hold.

3) You now wish to investigate the relationship between mortality rate and calcium concentration in drinking water. You focus on 25 different large towns across both countries and measure both these variables.
